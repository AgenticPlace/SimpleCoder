Subject: Justification for $25,000 Inference Credit Allocation - Pre-Seed Round 2 <br />
Date: October 27, 2023
1. Executive Summary: From Architectural Soundness to Systemic Intelligence
The MindX project has successfully completed its initial architectural phase. We have built and unit-tested a robust, multi-layered cognitive architecture for a Sovereign Intelligent Organization (SIO). The core components—Mastermind (strategy), Coordinator (kernel), AGInt (operational mind), BDIAgent (tactical brain), and SimpleCoder (secure execution)—are now in place.
The system is architecturally sound but currently inert. It is a brain with no memories and a workforce with no experience.
The requested $25,000 in inference credits is not for further development in the traditional sense. It is the minimum viable energy required to bootstrap the system's consciousness. This phase, which we call "The Great Ingestion," is a large-scale, computationally intensive process designed to populate the system's BeliefSystem with a foundational layer of battle-tested software engineering knowledge.
This is not a "big data" problem; it is a "deep knowledge" problem. The goal is not to store data, but to create a high-fidelity, vectorized graph of causal relationships between code patterns, performance benchmarks, and security vulnerabilities. This process is fundamentally driven by high-quality LLM inference at every stage.
2. The Great Ingestion: A Three-Stage Computational Workflow
The "Great Ingestion" is the primary activity for which these credits are required. It involves processing an initial corpus of 3,650 audited, high-quality open-source repositories. The process is not a simple file scan; it is a multi-agent, recursive analysis loop.
Here is the computational workflow for a single repository:
Stage 1: Codebase Assimilation (High Inference Cost)
MastermindAgent -> AGInt -> BDIAgent: The Mastermind initiates a campaign with the directive: "Assimilate repository [repo_url].".
BDIAgent -> SimpleCoder: A BDIAgent is spawned. Its first task is to use SimpleCoder to git clone the repository into its secure sandbox.
Recursive Analysis (CodeBaseGenerator): The BDI agent then uses a specialized tool (CodeBaseGenerator, which is LLM-powered) to recursively parse every single source file (.py, .js, .go, etc.). For each file, it performs an initial Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis.
Function-Level Cognitive Task: For each significant function or class identified in the AST, the BDI agent makes a dedicated LLM call.
Prompt: "You are a senior software architect. Analyze the following function: [function_code]. Identify its core purpose, its algorithmic complexity (Big O), its primary dependencies, and any potential security anti-patterns (e.g., raw SQL execution, shell=True). Respond ONLY in structured JSON."
Inference Cost: A mid-sized repository can have 500-2,000 functions. This translates to 500 - 2,000 high-quality reasoning calls per repository.
Stage 2: Relational Knowledge Graph Construction (Medium Inference Cost)
BDIAgent -> BeliefSystem: The structured JSON output from Stage 1 is saved as a "raw belief" in the system's memory.
AGInt -> BDIAgent (Synthesis Task): Once a repository is fully assimilated, AGInt spawns a new BDIAgent with the goal: "Synthesize the raw beliefs for repository [repo_name] into a relational knowledge graph."
Entity & Relationship Extraction: This BDI agent iterates through the raw beliefs and makes a series of LLM calls to establish connections.
Prompt: "Given these two function analyses: [JSON for func_A] and [JSON for func_B]. Does func_A have a direct or indirect dependency on func_B? What is the nature of their relationship (e.g., 'calls', 'inherits_from', 'is_test_for')? Respond ONLY in structured JSON."
Inference Cost: This stage involves combinatorial analysis. For a repository with N functions, the number of potential relationships can be very high. We use heuristics to limit this, but it still requires thousands of smaller, targeted inference calls per repository.
Stage 3: Adversarial Benchmarking & Verification (Highest Inference Cost & Compute Cost)
This is the most computationally expensive and unique part of the MindX architecture.
MastermindAgent -> AGInt (Verification Campaign): The Mastermind periodically initiates a campaign: "Verify and benchmark all assimilated algorithms tagged as 'sorting' or 'encryption'."
AGInt -> BDIAgent (Benchmark Generation): An AGInt delegates the task. A BDIAgent's LLM is prompted:
Prompt: "You are a test engineer. You have two Python functions, [func_A_code] and [func_B_code], both claiming to perform AES-256 encryption. Write a complete, executable 'pytest' script that benchmarks the performance (ops/sec) and verifies the correctness (encrypt/decrypt roundtrip) of both functions across a range of payload sizes (1KB, 1MB, 10MB). The script must output the results in a machine-readable JSON format to stdout."
BDIAgent -> SimpleCoder -> Google Cloud: The BDI agent uses SimpleCoder to:
Create a new directory.
Create a venv.
pip install necessary libraries (pytest, cryptography, etc.).
Write the LLM-generated test_benchmark.py file to disk.
Execute the benchmark using run 'pytest test_benchmark.py'. This will consume standard Google Compute Engine resources.
Result Canonization (Final Inference Step): The BDIAgent captures the JSON output from the benchmark. It then makes a final LLM call to create a canonical belief.
Prompt: "Benchmark results: [benchmark_JSON]. Conclude which function, func_A or func_B, is superior for payloads > 1MB. State the verified performance difference. Respond ONLY in structured JSON."
BeliefSystem Update: This final, verified conclusion ({"winner": "func_A", "margin": "17.5%"}) is committed to the BeliefSystem as a high-confidence, computationally-verified theorem.
3. Justification of Credit Amount ($25,000)
The $25k credit request is based on a conservative estimate of the inference workload for the initial corpus.
Target Corpus: 3,650 repositories.
Avg. Functions per Repo: 750 (conservative estimate).
Stage 1 Inference Calls: 3,650 repos * 750 calls/repo = 2,737,500 calls. (High-quality reasoning/code analysis models).
Stage 2 Inference Calls: Estimated at ~1.5x the Stage 1 calls due to relational mapping = ~4,100,000 calls. (Lower-cost, faster models for classification).
Stage 3 Inference Calls: We project ~50,000 critical algorithm pairs for initial benchmarking, each requiring ~2 LLM calls (test generation + result summarization) = 100,000 calls. (Highest-quality, instruction-following models).
Total Estimated Inference Calls: ~7 Million high-to-medium quality reasoning and generation calls.
This volume of deep, structured analysis is not optional—it is the capital investment required to create the intellectual bedrock of the SIO. A smaller credit amount would force us to process a smaller, less diverse corpus, fundamentally limiting the foundational intelligence and "worldview" of the system. A $25,000 credit provides the necessary runway to complete this critical "Great Ingestion" phase and demonstrate the system's exponential learning capabilities to our seed-stage investors.
We believe this represents an unprecedented opportunity for Google Cloud to power the inception of a truly novel form of intelligence, built from the ground up on verifiable, open-source knowledge. We appreciate your consideration.
